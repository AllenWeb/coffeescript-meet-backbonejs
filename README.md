# CoffeeScript, Meet Backbone.js

**CoffeeScript, Meet BackBone.js** is a simple [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) tutorial written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) comprised of self-explanatory "hello world" examples of increasing complexity. It was designed to provide a smoother transition from zero to the popular [Todos example](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html). The bulk of this tutorial is a rewrite of the original [hello-backbonejs](http://arturadib.github.com/hello-backbonejs/) tutorial.
